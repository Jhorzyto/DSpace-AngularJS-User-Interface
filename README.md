# DSpace-AngularJS-User-Interface
A user interface for DSpace implemented with the help of AngularJS and the DSpace REST API. I decided to implement the project after seeing a discussion in the dspace-tech mailing list about the DSpace UI Prototype Challenge. While I have no plans to enter, I just used it as an excuse to mess around with the DSpace REST API and angularJS.
